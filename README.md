# synthesize  

Inspired by science, **synthesize** recolors numbers and letters on webpages to induce grapheme–color synesthesia–like associations in the user.  

This Chrome extension is based on training protocols from *Bor et al. (2014)*, which showed that non-synesthetes can acquire synesthesia-like experiences through repeated, adaptive exposure.

## Features  
- **Automatic coloring** of letters (A–Z) and numbers (0–9) across all webpages.  
- **Custom mapping editor** in Options — pick your own colors or leave characters unchanged.  
- **Color presets**:
  - *Full Color* – apply to all letters and digits.  
  - *Bor et al.* – replicates the training set used in Bor et al. (2014).  
  - *Only Numbers* – maps only digits 0–9 (typical associations).  
  - *Only Letters* – maps A–Z only.  
- **Whitelist / Blacklist support** — control which sites are colored.  
- **Passive Drill** training task — replicates the original experimental “Passive Drill” (letters shown in color for 1s, background color for 500ms, repeated in cycles).  
- **Import / Export mappings** via text (JSON or simple `A=#ff0000` style).

No other permissions are required.
